This is the 1151 schedule; I should be moving the MOOC somewhat faster than it does.

* Week 1: Limits
** 1.4 Review of functions
*** VIDEO introduction to course format
*** VIDEO What is a function? :what-is-a-function:
Physically "build" a function
What is is *not* a function
<<<<<<< HEAD
**** We should probably limit our definition as a function from R -> R.
A function from R -> R is a paring where every element in R is mapped
to some element in R.  Moreover, we can discuss how Functions might
not have an inverse.
*** KHAN graph transformations

*** VIDEO Why do I care about limits? :why-care-about-limits:
**** Motivating Example: 
(x^2 - 3x + 2)/(x-2), plot for integer values of x from -1 to 2,
excluding x=2. Explain how this is *not* equal to x-1, and that a
limit is needed.

*** VIDEO Why does the limit of a sum equal the sum of the limits? :limit-of-sum:
ask three different people to do three different multiplication
problems, all slightly different but with answers nearby each
other---how do their answers compare?
I can do this by printing the problem out in giant letters on the
paper and giving it to them.
