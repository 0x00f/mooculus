Topics

* Terminal Velocity

* sling shot (tangent line)
* ball in a half plate, whole plate (tangent line)

* Week 1: Limits
** 1.4 Review of functions
*** VIDEO introduction to course format
*** VIDEO what is a function?
Physically "build" a function
What is is *not* a function
*** y = f(x-3) shifts the graph?  
*** KHAN graph transformations
*** KHAN lines and slope
*** We should probably limit our definition as a function from R -> R.
A function from R -> R is a paring where every element in R is mapped
to some element in R.  Moreover, we can discuss how Functions might
not have an inverse.
** 2.1 Idea of limits
*** VIDEO what is a limit?  plug in nearby values
*** VIDEO reading limits from a graph
*** KHAN evaluating limits from a graph, piecewise functions, discontinuous
*** VIDEO why do we care about limits?  any time we have approximations we can improve
*** Motivating Example: 
(x^2 - 3x + 2)/(x-2), plot for integer values of x from -1 to 2,
excluding x=2. Explain how this is *not* equal to x-1, and that a
limit is needed.
** 2.2 Definition of limits
*** KHAN start with function square root(X^2+2)/|X| 
- ask about evaluating this at various points to suggest continuity 
*** VIDEO one-sided limits
*** VIDEO relationship between one and two sided limits
*** VIDEO a limit may not exist
** 2.3 Limit laws
*** VIDEO limit of a sum is the sum of the limits
ask three different people to do three different multiplication
problems, all slightly different but with answers nearby each
other---how do their answers compare?
I can do this by printing the problem out in giant letters on the
paper and giving it to them.
*** VIDEO limit of a product is the product of the limits
ask three different people to do three different multiplication
problems, all slightly different but with answers nearby each
other---how do their answers compare?
