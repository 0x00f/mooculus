* An augmented reality lecture video system

** Tools included

find-markers locates the markers and prints them on stdout; a moving
marker (especially in an interlaced video) might not be detected, so a
cubic spline fills in data for those missing frames.

** Dependencies

This code uses [[http://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/26][ArUco]], a minimal library for Augmented Reality
applications based on [[http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/][OpenCV]].  It also depends on [[http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/][The GNU Scientific
Library (GSL)]] for the cubic spline algorithm.

** Installing

The Makefile assumes that ArUco is installed in /usr/local and
pkg-config for everything else.
