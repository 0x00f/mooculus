* Limits
** artisian diver, secent lines -> velocity
* Giving slightly different arithmetic problems to a few people to demonstrate continuity
* Terminal Velocity
** This should work into limits -- penny dropped kill someone?
** Cooling - limit to infinity
** Guitar string settles down 
** Auger dish 
* Drop a ball
** Use R = D/T to comptute the speed. 
*** Start with the average velocity over the total amount of time
*** Next point out that the ball is moving a different rates at different times
*** We could plot the position over time. 
*** Next we could compute tangent lines on the plot and compare this with the actual footage.
