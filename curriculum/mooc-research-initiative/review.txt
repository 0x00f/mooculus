Thank you for your submission to the MOOC Research Initiative. I'm 
pleased to inform you that your
submission MOOCulus: Iteratively Improving Calculus Instruction has been 
selected, by peer reviewers, for a full submission.

The full submission should follow the format of your short submission:
1. Proposal overview
2. Literature and existing research that informs their proposal
3. Context of research (MOOC taught, designed, university/organizational 
affiliation, MOOC provider,
publisher)
4. Research questions to be addressed by the project
5. Data sources being considered for the project
6. Methodology planned for research activities

Additionally, please include a section on your budget needs. MRI will 
fund proposals in the $10,000-
$25,000 range.

Your final application should be in the range of 6-8 pages (excluding 
citations) and should use 12 pt Times
New Roman font. Please consider feedback from reviewers as you extend 
your proposal.

DEADLINE: We have extended the deadline for proposals to August 27, 2013 
- a slight delay of the
previously planned deadline to account for the delay in notifying you of 
your acceptance.

Sincerely,

George Siemens
On behalf of the MRI Steering Committee and Reviewers

PAPER: 101
TITLE: MOOCulus: Iteratively Improving Calculus Instruction
AUTHORS: Jim Fowler and Bart Snapp

OVERALL EVALUATION: 3 (strong accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (high)
Quality of the Proposed Work: Research method techniques and tools to be 
used are CLEAR; novel contribution to research and ability to compare 
results with established research and/or other MOOC research: 4 (good)
Access to data and description of tools and methods: How they are going 
to access the data for analysis;  data as aligned with research 
questions.: 5 (excellent)
Experience and capacity of researchers to conduct the work: Evaluation 
of the researchers' expertise in the MOOC area and/or in the research 
methods proposed.: 5 (excellent)
Clear definition of scope of analysis and application and context of 
application (e.g. upper-division STEM courses using xMOOCs), and whether 
research allows application beyond one course or discipline: 4 (good)

----------- REVIEW -----------
The proposal aims to examine user logs from a MOOC add-on called 
MOOCulus to investigate adaptive learning. The approach is sound and 
should provide detailed insight into adaptive learning models and use of 
hints or analysis of carelessness.

PAPER: 101
TITLE: MOOCulus: Iteratively Improving Calculus Instruction
AUTHORS: Jim Fowler and Bart Snapp

OVERALL EVALUATION: 0 (borderline paper)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (high)
Quality of the Proposed Work: Research method techniques and tools to be 
used are CLEAR; novel contribution to research and ability to compare 
results with established research and/or other MOOC research: 3 (fair)
Access to data and description of tools and methods: How they are going 
to access the data for analysis;  data as aligned with research 
questions.: 3 (fair)
Experience and capacity of researchers to conduct the work: Evaluation 
of the researchers' expertise in the MOOC area and/or in the research 
methods proposed.: 3 (fair)
Clear definition of scope of analysis and application and context of 
application (e.g. upper-division STEM courses using xMOOCs), and whether 
research allows application beyond one course or discipline: 3 (fair)

----------- REVIEW -----------
I felt this paper was too closely focused around one course and that the 
results would not be generalisable. The MOOC calculus tool might be 
useful, but it doesn't fit into the broader research initiative as well 
as other proposals.
