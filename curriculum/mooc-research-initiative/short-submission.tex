  \textbf{MOOCulus: Iteratively Improving Calculus Instruction}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Proposal overview}

In January 2013, The Ohio State University Mathematics Department
launched its first massive open online course. This MOOC was designed
to cover the same content as the local, in-person sections of calculus
at Ohio State. Part of this MOOC consisted of a home-built platform
designed to deliver randomly-generated interactive mathematics
problems to students. With tens of thousands of students enrolled in
this MOOC, there have been millions of attempts on homework exercises,
with data on each of these attempts.  Funding is sought to use this
data to both evaluate the success of and improve upon OSU's calculus
MOOC. In turn, it is hoped that this system can be implemented to
improve teaching and learning at Ohio State.

\subsubsection*{Context of research}

Coursera was chosen as the MOOC provider, but since Coursera's
platform lacked randomly generated math problems, the team at Ohio
State built their own MOOC platform to complement Coursera's
services---this home-built platform is called MOOCulus, and can be
explored at \url{https://mooculus.osu.edu/}.

MOOCulus logs all student input on homework exercises. This data is
fed into a hidden Markov model to produce an estimate of the student's
understanding. The student receives additional practice problems of
the same sort until it is estimated that their understanding reaches a
threshold, at which point the student is given a new type of exercise
and the process repeats.  The overall goal is to keep providing
exercises that are difficult enough to be fun and educational, but not
so easy as to become boring and repetitive.  In spite of the fact that
many tens of thousands of students used MOOCulus, each experienced a
personalized path through the material.  In short, MOOCulus promises
to enable MOOCs to be massive, but not mass-produced.

In addition to building MOOCulus and running Calculus One, both Fowler
and Snapp have experience using technology and analyzing its
effectiveness.  For example, Fowler built the mobile phone clicker
used to measure student engagement for OSU's technology enhanced
calculus lectures, and Fowler's research training includes
high-dimensional data analysis from a topological perspective; Snapp
taught for Calculus Remote at OSU (CROSU), and worked with OSU's
Center for Enterprise Transformation \& Innovation to build
interactive textbooks for the iPad, with the goal of measuring student
engagement while reading the textbook.

\subsubsection*{Data sources}

A large data set already exists from the first run of the Calculus One
MOOC in Spring 2013; with an initial enrollment of 35,000 students,
the course still had 11,000 students engaging with the material after
four weeks, and 2,000 students at Week~15.  Altogether, a total of
2,079,428 correct answers were submitted to MOOCulus, with a total of
10.3 person-years having been spent by students working problems.  The
activity logs are stored in a SQL database and this database is
imported for analysis into R.

In Fall 2013, the Calculus One MOOC will be taught again at OSU.  In
addition Snapp will be teaching two on-campus calculus courses: a
course for engineers and a course for teachers.  Fowler and Snapp have
obtained a letter of final determination from the Institutional Review
Board facilitating the use of human subjects in our research.  The
proposed plan is to have each of these groups of students enroll in
MOOCulus so that we can directly compare students' performance in the
online course with their in-class performance.


\subsubsection*{Research question}

As students interact with MOOCulus, the data needed to refine the
parameters of the hidden Markov model are obtained.  At this point a
number of questions arise. To what degree is a correct answer after
three ``hints'' strong evidence of student understanding?  What prior
probability should be assigned to the likelihood of a student to
submit a correct answer on the first try?  The parameters depend
strongly on the particular homework exercise; some exercises are
conceptually deep but procedurally easy, while some questions are
conceptually light but procedurally quite involved, so even a strong
student may make ``careless'' mistakes which the model shouldn't count
against him/her.  It's easy for an expert to qualitatively make these
judgments, but analysis of big data is required to accurately set
these parameters.

This leads to two basic questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item What parameters in the adaptive
  learning model best align online student performance with in-class
  student performance?
\item To what extent does student use
  of adaptive learning correlate with success in traditional,
  in-person courses?
\end{itemize}
The former question addresses improving the hidden Markov model that
powers MOOCulus; the second question gets deeper, by addressing the
extent to which adaptive learning helps with in-person courses.

\subsubsection*{Literature}

Hidden Markov models are widely used in educational data mining; one
nice example of such is Shih-Koedinger-Scheines' 2010 paper
presented at the International Conference on Educational Data Mining,
``Discovery of Student Strategies using Hidden Markov Model
Clustering.''  The survey papers of Romero and Ventura provide an
excellent overview.

\subsubsection*{Methodology}

To set the parameters of the hidden Markov model, the Baum-Welch
algorithm will be used on data gathered from the first run of the
Calculus One MOOC. This will allow the parameters in the MOOCulus
hidden Markov model will be set for each problem separately, for a
more effective implementation in Spring 2013.

To assess the correlation between success in the MOOC and success in
the traditional course, in addition to teaching the online MOOC, Snapp
will be teaching calculus to two, quite different, student populations
in Fall 2013.  The first is a calculus course for middle school
teachers ($n=28$); the second is a calculus course for engineering
students ($n\approx 180$).  By involving his in-person students also
in the online MOOCulus course, the extent to which participation in
the adaptive learning system correlates with success on in-person
assessments can be determined.
