<h3>Applications of integration</h3>

<p>Last week, in <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week14">Week
14</a>, we looked at some techniques of integration; this week, we
wrap up the course 
by <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/377"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;working
through some applications of integration, emphasizing volume
calculations.</a>  If you want to discuss any topic in the course (or
in mathematics generally!),
please <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">post your questions and
comments to the forum</a>
or <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">bring it up during
Office Hours</a> on April 19, 2013 at 11:30AM EDT.</p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>final exam</strong> is now available.  I wish
you the very best.</p>

<h3>How else can I calculate area?</h3>

<p>We've already done some area calculations, but it might surprise
you to find out that we can <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/391"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;calculate area using horizontal
rectangles</a>.  And if we can do it with both horizontal and vertical
rectangles, we should think about <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/385"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;how to decide which sort of rectangle to
use.</a></p>

<p>You can practice <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/areaBetweenCurves"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;area calculations on mooculus.</a></p>

<h3>How can I calculate volume?</h3>

<p>The basic idea for calculating volume is to <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/393"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;slice solid objects up into pieces, and
integrate the volume of the pieces.</a>  The idea is that the volume
formula for the pieces is much easier, so integration is promoting
&ldquo;easy&rdquo; knowledge into the harder knowledge of volume of
crazily shaped object.</p>

<h4>With disks!</h4>

<p>Volume calculations are discussed starting on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;230
of the Textbook</a>, and there you can find some truly beautiful
three-dimensional pictures.  Please take a look!  Once we have the
basic idea, we can  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/387"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;calculate the volume of a sphere</a> by
slicing the sphere into thin disks.</p>

<h4>With washers!</h4>

<p>One nice source of examples are <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution">solids of
revolution</a>.  If there's a cavity in such, we might try  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/389"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;slicing the object into washers</a> to
compute its volume.</p>

<h4>With shells!</h4>

<p>The pieces can be more complicated than just cross sections.  For
instance, we can cut an object <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/397"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;into thin shells,</a> providing a nice way
to  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/383"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;calculate the volume of a sphere with a
hole drilled into it.</a></p>

<p>You can practice <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/volumeRevolution"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;volume calculations on mooculus.</a></p>


<h3>How can I calculate length?</h3>

<p>Length is <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/395"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;a bit more subtle than one might
think</a>, but we have a definition in terms of an integral.  We can
use that definition to compute <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/381"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the length of an arc along the graph of
$$y^2 = x^3$$.</a></p>

<p>You can practice <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/arclength"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;arc length calculations on mooculus.</a></p>


<h3>At the end of the week&hellip; which is the end of the course!</h3>

<p>When you've reached the end of the week, take
the <a href="/calc1-001/quiz/start?quiz_id=41">final
examination</a>.  To prepare you and to help you know what to expect
when you take the real final exam, we've prepared
a <a href="/calc1-001/quiz/start?quiz_id=429">fake version of the final
exam</a> for you to use as practice.  <strong>Only the real final will
count towards your final course grade; the fake final is just for
fun.</strong></p>

<p>Unlike the midterms, which are designed not only to assess but also
to teach you new techniques, you will, I hope, find the final exam
focuses on core concepts of the course.  To avoid issues with input,
the exam is multiple choice.  <strong>You have until the beginning of
May to finish the exam.</strong></p>

<p>And although it seems we have reached the
end, <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/379"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;I
am pretty much in denial.</a>  But let me simply say this: it has been
my honor and my pleasure to be one of your many guides through
mathematics.  I have had a ton of fun putting this together, and I
very much look forward to more.  Until we meet again!</p>
