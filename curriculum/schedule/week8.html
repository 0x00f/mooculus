<h3>Optimization</h3>

<p>Last week, during <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week7">Week 7</a>, we started studying
applications of the derivative: we continue applications this week,
focusing on <strong>optimization problems</strong>.  There's a wide
variety of <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/207"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;optimization problems that calculus will
help us solve</a>.</p>

<p>These &ldquo;word problems&rdquo; can be quite complicated: not
only can the calculus be tricky, but just translating the word
problem into mathematics can be very hard.  If you're confused, please
let me know <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">in the
forum</a>&mdash;we need your help knowing what is easy and what is
hard, so we can improve this course for the future.  And to talk about
this in person, we'll hold  <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">Office
Hours</a> on February 27 at 11:30AM EST.  I'm looking forward to
talking with you all again!</p>


<h3>Is optimization even possible?</h3>

<p>If you're about to set out on a quest, it helps to know whether
your quest will be successful!  The <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/201"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;Extreme Value Theorem</a> states that
<blockquote>
If a function \(f\) is continuous on the closed interval \([a,b]\),
then there are \(c\) and \(d\) in \([a,b]\) 
so that for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\), 
\(f(c) \leq f(x)\) and \(f(x) \leq f(d)\).
</blockquote>
You can read more on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i
class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;138 of the Textbook</a>.  The
upshot is that <strong>continuous functions on closed intervals attain
their maximum and minimum value</strong>, so, yes, in many cases our
search for the &ldquo;optimum&rdquo; value is not a fool's errand!</p>

<h3>Okay, so if optimization is possible, how do I do it?</h3>

<p>There's a process for <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/205"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;finding the maximum and minimum values of
a function \(f\) on a given domain</a>.  You should</p>
<ul>
  <li>differentiate \(f\),</li>
  <li>find critical points,</li>
  <li>check critical points and endpoints, and</li>
  <li>check the behavior near the left and right hand endpoints, if you're working over, say, an open interval.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key points are to <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/209"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;remember to check the endpoints</a> and  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/217"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;remember that critical points include
points of nondifferentiability</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a
href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/optimizationCubic"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;practice finding maximums and minimums
on mooculus</a>.</p>

<h3>Why would I want to optimize a function?</h3>

<p>In the real world, we must makes choices, and wouldn't it be great
if we could make the best choice?  For instance, you might  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/203"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;want to enclose the most area inside a
rectangular fence</a>.  In broad strokes, the process goes as
follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Draw a picture;</li>
  <li>write down your goal&mdash;what quantity you are trying to
  maximize or minimize;</li>
  <li>note any constraints;</li>
  <li>rewrite your goal as a function of a single variable;</li>
  <li>apply calculus&mdash;use what we've learned to find the value
  which maximizes or minimizes your function of a single variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about this on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i
class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;141 of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>It is worth pointing out that <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/221"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;you do not necessarily need calculus to
solve many of these problems</a> since you can use, for instance, the
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_of_arithmetic_and_geometric_means">AM-GM
inequality.</a>  And although problems like <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/211"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;finding the optimal shape of a soup
can</a> are a ton of fun, there are certainly other considerations to
worry about in the real world which are likely more important than
surface area.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, other examples like <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/213"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;where three bubbles meet</a> are rich 
mathematically, and can be seen in the real world. If you want to consider <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/215"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;how large of an object can be taken around
a corner</a>, you should <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/calc1/PDFs/hallway-corner.pdf">print it out and try it for
yourself</a>.

<p>Our last example is the  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/219"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;fence-clearing problem</a> which makes
some nice connections to our previous work.  There are many more <a
href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;word problems available on mooculus</a>.</p>

<h3>At the end of the week&hellip;</h3>

<p>When you've reached the end of the week, take the <a
href="/calc1-001/quiz/index">End of Week 8 Quiz</a>.  Let me warn you that
there is a question about the <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/201"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;extreme value theorem</a>, four questions
about <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/205"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;optimizing functions</a> and five more
&ldquo;applied&rdquo; problems.</p>

<p>If you find yourself confused about any exercises, please <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">post a message on the
forum</a> so we can help out, or <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">discuss
it with us during office hours</a>.  I hope you enjoy the problems
this week. <strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
