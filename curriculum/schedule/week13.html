<h3>Substitution rule</h3>

<p>With the fundamental theorem of calculus in hand, we can integrate
by antidifferentiating&mdash;but antidifferentiating is not so
easy!  This week, in Week 13, with study
<strong>$$u$$-substitution</strong>, which systematizes the process of
using the chain rule in reverse.  Considering how often we used the
chain rule when differentiating, it should not be too surprising that
we will often need to use it in reverse when antidifferentiating.</p>

<p>If you're feeling lost in the course, please <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">post a message to the
forum</a>; let me also say a bit about <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/333"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;how this course is organized as a
whole.</a>  For our three major topics (limits, derivatives, and integrals), we study definitions, techniques,
and applications.  For example, in  <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week11">Week 11</a>, we studied the
definition of the definite integral, and in  <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week10">Week 12</a>, we studied a
technique for evaluating such integrals: the fundamental theorem of
calculus.  This week and next week, we refine our techniques for
evaluating integrals, waiting for applications of integration in <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week10">Week 15</a>.</p>

<h3>What is the chain rule backwards?</h3>

<p>When we <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/347"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;use the chain rule backwards to antidifferentiate</a>, I'll call it <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution">$$u$$-substitution</a>,
since the convention is to name the &ldquo;inside&rdquo; function
$$u$$.  The hard part of performing these substitutions is <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/343"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;deciding what $$u$$ should be.</a>.  You
might <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/335"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;even want to perform multiple substitutions.</a></p>

<p>But that's really emphasize indefinite integration&mdash;that is,
just antidifferentiation.  There are <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/353"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;two approaches to evaluating definite
integrals by $$u$$-substitution.</a></p>

<p>Integration by substitution is discussed on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;214
of the Textbook</a>, and you can practice <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/variableSub1"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;antidifferentiating by substitution on mooculus.</a></p>

<h3>What are some tricks for doing substitutions?</h3>

<p>There's a ton of tricks for making $$u$$-substitutions!  One of
them is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completing_the_square">completing
the square</a> which facilitates <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/341"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;evaluating integrals which include
quadratic polynomials</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is easier to make a substitution like $$u = x - 1$$
and then use the fact that $$x = u + 1$$ to rewrite the integrand.
This is <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/337"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;back substitution.</a>  Along those same
lines, sometimes you can choose $$u$$ so you can rewrite the integrand
as a rational function; this is a <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/339"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;rationalizing substitution.</a>  And other
times, you can use <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/345"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;trigonometric identities</a> to rewrite
the integrand.  There's a lot of room for creativity!</p>

<h3>What if I differentiate an accumulation function?</h3>

<p>The chain rule can be used in other ways to understand definite
integrals.  For instance, I can use the chain rule to <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/351"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;differentiate a more
complicated version of an accumulation function, like
$$\displaystyle\int_0^{x^2} \sin t \, dt$$.</a></p>

<p>Thinking about the derivative of accumulation functions, we are
also in a position to give a <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/349"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;formal proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus.</a></p>

<p>And thinking about formal proofs, there's a funny thing about
$$u$$-substitution: a justification of $$u$$-substitution goes through the
fundamental theorem and the chain rule, but the resulting statement is
just a statement about definite integrals.  It is possible to see <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/349"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;an intuitive argument as to why
substitution works for definite integration</a>, boiling down to the
fact that you can stretch a rectangle horizontally or vertically, and
still change the area in the same way.</p>

<h3>At the end of the week&hellip;</h3>

<p>When you've reached the end of the week, take the <a
href="/calc1-001/quiz/index">End of Week 13 Quiz</a>.  You can expect
a lot of $$u$$-substitution!  If you want a hint, or just to shout out
your success, feel free to <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">post a message on the
forum</a> so we can share in your worries and in your successes.  And
remember to <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">join office hours</a>.
We're almost there!</p>
