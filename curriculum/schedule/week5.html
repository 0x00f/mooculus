<h3>Chain Rule</h3>

<p>Previously, in <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week4">Week
4</a>, we worked on techniques of differentiation&mdash;specifically,
the product and quotient
rules.  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;Is there anything more to learn about derivatives?</a>  Yes!  This
week, in Week 5, we'll learn the <strong>chain rule</strong> which
lets us differentiate the composition of two functions.</p>

<p>This week's <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">Office
Hours</a> will be held on February 5, 2013 at 5:30PM EST.  And this
week we're rolling out a
couple <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/explorations">explorations</a>:
one which lets you <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/explorations/derivative">differentiate any function, and see the solution
step-by-step</a>; the other lets you <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/explorations/graph">graph and wiggle extra variables with
sliders</a>.  If you have ideas about other explorations or other ways to
improve the course, please <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">post your
ideas in the forum</a>.

<h3>How do I differentiate the composition of two functions?</h3>

<p>Suppose \(f\) is differentiable at \(a\) and \(g\) is
differentiable at \(f(a\).  Then \(\left(g \circ f\right)\) is
differentiable at \(a\), and 
<blockquote>
\(\left(g \circ f\right)'(a) = g'(f(a))\, f'(a)\).
</blockquote>
This is the celebrated <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;chain rule</a> and you can read more about it on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;79
of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>You might wonder why you'd care about such a rule: a couple
examples where it helps
include <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;differentiating \((1+2x)^5\) and \(\sqrt{x^2+0.0001}\)</a>.  The
slogan &ldquo;derivative of the outside function at the inside, times
the derivative of the inside&rdquo; will, I hope, make it easy to
remember what to do!  It takes practice.

<h3>How do I find the tangent line to a curve?</h3>

<p>Sometimes, we're given equations like \(y^2 - x^3 + x - 1 = 0\); we
can plot the points satisfying this equation in the plane, but the
resulting curve fails the vertical line test&mdash;so there's no
function which has that whole curve as its graph.  Nevertheless, we can
still ask for a tangent line to the curve: the trick
is <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;implicit differentiation</a>, which you can read about
on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;86 of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>There's a bunch of fascinating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve">curves in the plane</a>, but one example stands out historically: 
 <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the
 folium of Descartes</a>, given by \(x^3 + y^3 - 3axy = 0\) for some
 choice of \(a\).  Descartes challenged Fermat to find the tangent
 line to the curve; Fermat solved the problem, and now so can you,
 using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function#Implicit_differentiation">implicit
 differentiation</a>.</p>

<h3>How do I find the derivative of an inverse function?</h3>

<p>Given an invertible function \(f\), the derivative measures how
changing the input affects the output.  The derivative of the inverse
\(f^{-1}\) encodes how wiggling the output of \(f\) would
&ldquo;affect&rdquo; the input to \(f\), so perhaps it is reasonable
to expect that
<blockquote>
\( \left( f^{-1} \right)'(y) = \displaystyle\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(y))} \).
</blockquote>
This is made precise with the <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;inverse
function theorem</a>.</p>

<p>As a particular example, the inverse of the function \(f(x) = e^x\)
is the <strong>natural logarithm</strong>.
We <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;compute
the derivative of log</a> and find that 
<blockquote>
\(\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx} \log x = \displaystyle\frac{1}{x}\).
</blockquote>
Note that I follow the
convention that there is only one log&mdash;the natural log&mdash;so I
write it as \(\log x\); sometimes you'll see this function denoted
\(\ln x\) instead.</p>

<p>Once we know that \(\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}
\log x = \displaystyle\frac{1}{x}\), there is one fun application of this fact: <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;logarithmic differentiation</a>, which you can read more about on
<a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;91
of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<h3>How can I multiply quickly?</h3>

<p>Multiplication is an extremely important operation, so we
should <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;figure
out how to multiply quickly</a>.  Thousands of years ago, the
Babylonians
used <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/calc1/PDFs/quartersquares.pdf"><i class="icon-file"></i>&nbsp;quartersquares</a>
which makes multiplication faster, but requires a separate table for
division.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm#From_Napier_to_Euler">Logarithms
are even better</a> since logs, for instance, not only turn multiplication into addition, but division into subtraction.  You can play around with logarithms by printing out your very own <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/calc1/PDFs/log-table.pdf"><i class="icon-file"></i>&nbsp;log table</a> or <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/calc1/PDFs/sliderule.pdf"><i class="icon-file"></i>&nbsp;slide rule</a>.</p>

<h3>How do I justify the derivative rules?</h3>

<p>We've been using the power rule, but so far, we only checked it for positive, whole number exponents; <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;how do we justify the power rule in general?</a>  One way is with logarithms!  Because logarithms convert multiplication into addition, we can also use logs to give <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;another proof of the product rule</a>.</p>

<p>Last week, in Week 4, we introduced the <strong>quotient rule</strong> but we didn't prove it; with the product rule and chain rule and power rule, we can now give <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;a proof of the quotient rule.</a></p>

<h3>At the end of the week&hellip;</h3>

<p>When you've reached the end of the week, take the <a href="/calc1-001/quiz/index">End of Week 5 Quiz</a>.  So you aren't surprised when you take the quiz, you should expect</p>
<ul>
<li>three questions involving <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the chain rule</a>,</li>
<li>three questions combining the chain rule with <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the derivative of log</a>,</li>
<li>two questions about <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;implicit differentiation</a>, like the <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;folium of Descartes</a>, and</li>
<li>two questions for which <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/BADBAD"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;logarithmic differentiation</a> might help.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you do really well on this week's quiz; if you aren't sure
how to differentiate something, you might
find <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/explorations/derivative">the
derivative exploration</a> helpful; if you are stuck, you might also
want to <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">post a message on the
forum</a> or <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">discuss
it with me during office hours</a>.  <strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
