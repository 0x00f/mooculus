<h3>Techniques of Differentiation</h3>

<p>Last week, in <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week3">Week 3</a>, we first
met derivatives; if you are
wondering <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/117"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;what
Week 4 will bring</a>, wonder no more: we will be computing more
derivatives!  Most importantly, this week we learn the <strong>product
rule</strong> and the <strong>quotient rule</strong>, which will let
us take derivatives of products and quotients, respectively.

<p>If you want help, have ideas for how to improve the course, or just
want to chat, please <strong>post your thoughts</strong>
by <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">using the forum</a>.  As is now our custom, we'll
holding <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">Office
Hours</a> on January 31, 2013 at 9:30AM EST.</p>

<p>Additionally, this week we're rolling out a
new <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/testingRandFunction"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;answer
type on mooculus</a>, which lets you enter mathematical expression in
a very free form way, and get instant feedback.  At the
moment, <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/J._D._Salinger#Seymour:_An_Introduction_.281959.29">the
parentheses are in bloom</a> but we're working on fixing that.</p>

<h3>How do I differentiate a product?</h3>

<p>To <strong>differentiate the product</strong> of two differentiable functions,
use <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/109"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the
product rule</a>, which states that</p>
<blockquote>
$$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx} \left( f(x) \, g(x) \right) = f'(x) \, g(x) + f(x) \, g'(x).$$
</blockquote>
<p>That looks wrong!  But <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/115"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;it makes sense geometrically</a>, and 
<a href="/calc1-001/lecture/105"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;there's
a formal proof</a> which you can read
on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;72
of the Textbook.</a></p>

<p>Be sure to <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/productRuleCompute"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;practice computing with the product rule.</a></p>

<h3>How do I differentiate a quotient?</h3>

<p>Once you can differentiate a product, you might suspect there is a <strong>quotient rule</strong>.  Indeed, <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/101"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;there is a quotient rule</a> but it can be <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/99"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;difficult to remember</a> considering that the quotient rule says that
<blockquote>
$$
\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx} \displaystyle\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 
\displaystyle\frac{f'(x)\, g(x) - f(x)\, g'(x)}{g(x)^2}.
$$
</blockquote>
<p>You will find a proof of the quotient rule on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;75
of the Textbook</a>; another proof will appear next week, by combining the power rule, product rule, and the chain rule.</p>

<p>Be sure to <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/quotientRuleCompute"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;practice computing with the quotient rule.</a></p>

<h3>Higher derivatives?</h3>

<p>Since the derivative is a function, we can <strong>differentiate
the derivative</strong> to get the <strong>second derivative</strong>
of a function.  But that raises a
question: <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/109"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;what
do these higher derivatives mean?</a>.  If we
consider <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/107"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the
sign of the second derivative</a>, we'll find that it encodes
information about the <strong>concavity</strong> of the function;
there are some graphs
on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;60
of the Textbook</a>, and you
can <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/secondDerivativeSign"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;play
with concavity on mooculus.</a>
</p>

<p>Once we are talking about <strong>derivatives in the
abstract</strong>, you might
wonder <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/107"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;whether
$$\frac{d}{dx}$$ has any meaning by itself</a>.  You might think of
$$\frac{d}{dx}$$ sort of like you think of $$f$$ as opposed to
$$f(x)$$, by which I mean $$\frac{d}{dx}$$ is &ldquo;the derivative
not applied yet to anything.&rdquo; If you keep taking more math
classes (and I hope you will!), you'll learn more about this
perspective when you
study <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator">differential
operators</a>.</p>

<h3>How can I sketch a graph without a computer?</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard Hamming</a> wrote in the preface to one of his books that &ldquo;the purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.&rdquo;  I agree!  Given a function, your goal is to <strong>describe the qualitative features</strong> of that function.</p>

<p>Chief among those qualitative features are <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/111"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;extreme values</a>, which you will find defined on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;53 of the Textbook.</a>  Once we know we're looking for extrema, we have to figure out a way to find what we desire; <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/123"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;Fermat's theorem</a>, which you'll find on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;54 of the Textbook</a> helps.  It says that the only place you'll find a local minimum or a local maximum is at a <strong>critical point</strong>, meaning an input $$x$$ where either $$f'(x) = 0$$ or $$f'(x)$$ doesn't exist.</p>

<p>By combining information about extrema and the sign of the first
derivative and the sign of the second derivative, you
can <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/119"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;sketch
graphs which illustrate the qualitative features of a function</a>.
The procedure is outlined
on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;67
of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes people are tricked into thinking that, if you're standing at a local minimum, the function is decreasing to your left and increasing to your right.  There are some <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/125"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;pathological examples which should dissuade you from that notion</a>.</p>

<p>Practicing the <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/intuitiveCurveSketch"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;various skills related to curve sketching</a> is a good way to review much of what we've done in the course thus far&mdash;write down a random function, and see if you can draw a picture of your random creation!</p>

<h3>How do I differentiate $$e^x$$?</h3>

Remember back to <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week2">Week 2</a>,
when we used the Intermediate Value Theorem to
find <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/57"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;fixed
points of functions</a>, meaning inputs $$x$$ so that $$f(x) = x$$?
We can ask if there is a <strong>fixed point</strong> of
$$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}$$, meaning a <em>function</em> which is
unchanged when you differentiate it.  Admittedly, $$f(x) = 0$$ is such an example, but
a more exciting example is <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/57"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the
function $$f(x) = e^x$$, which is also its own derivative</a>.  You can read the
proof on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;50
of the Textbook.</a>
