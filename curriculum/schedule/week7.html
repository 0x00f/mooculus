<h3>Applications of the derivative</h3>

<p>Our first midterm was last week, during <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week6">Week 6</a>; last week we also learned
about derivatives of trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric
functions.  So at this point, we can differentiate a ton of
functions&mdash;with the chain rule from <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week5">Week 5</a>, we're can
differentiate complicated compositions, too.</p>

<p>So, <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/181"><i
 class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;what do we do with this new
knowledge?</a> This week, we cover two applications: l'H&ocirc;pital's
rule and related rates.  To talk about this material in person, we'll
also hold <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">Office
Hours</a> will be held on February 21, 2013 at 3:30PM EST; we can also
chat about this new material <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">in the
forum</a>.</p>

<h3>How do derivatives help with limits?</h3>

<p>It is a bit surprising that <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/184"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;derivatives can help us to evaluate
limits</a>.  This is <strong>l'H&ocirc;pital's rule</strong>, and
initially, it is only helpful for limits where the numerator and
denominator are heading towards zero, but <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/187"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;it is possible to transform quite a few
limit problems so that l'H&ocirc;pital's rule applies</a>.</p>

<p>Be sure to <a
href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/lhopital"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;practice using l'H&ocirc;pital's
rule</a>.  You can find  l'H&ocirc;pital's rule on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;112
of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>As a bit of a warning: sometimes students get so very excited about l'H&ocirc;pital's rule that
they want to use it everywhere, but please <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/21"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;do not fall in love with
l'H&ocirc;pital</a>.</p>

<h3>How do derivatives help me understand rates of change in the real
world?</h3>

<p>On <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i
class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;121 of the Textbook</a>, you'll
be reminded that the derivative is, fundamentally, measuring the rate
of change.  For example, you can use derivatives to <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/189"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;discuss the rate of growth of
bacteria</a>, or you can use derivatives to measure  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/195"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;how quickly the distance between you and a
passing car is changing</a>; the derivative can then be heard as
<a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/explorations/doppler">doppler shift</a>.</p>

<h3>How do derivatives help me understand how two rates of changes are
related?</h3>

<p>If you have an equation relating two quantities, and both those
quantities are changing, you can explore the relationships between
those rates of change; these are <strong>related rates</strong>, and
you can find an introduction to the subject on <a
 href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i
 class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;127 of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>The basic technique to solving such a problem goes as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Draw a picture, labeling the relevant quantities.</li>
  <li>Write down an equation, using your diagram as a starting
  point.</li>
  <li>Differentiate the equation, remembering to regard quantities as
  depending on a variable \(t\), for time.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the result to find whatever you wanted to know about.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, it gets tricky, because these are <strong>word
problems</strong> so there are many opportunities for confusion!</p>

<p>A classic question is  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/183"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;how fast a shadow's length changes as you
walk</a>, which you can also <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/relatedRatesShadowBuilding"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;attempt on mooculus</a>.  Another
classic is studying <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/191"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;how fast a ladder slides down a building</a>.</p>

<p>You can see these things in the real world by thinking about <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/193"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;bowls filling with water</a> or <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/197"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;balloons filling with air</a>.   Often you
will have to use certain geometric facts, like <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/199"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the volume of a cone</a> in order to make
progress.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/relatedRatesBacteria"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;quite a few related rates problems on
mooculus</a>.  Remember you can use the forward arrow key to skip past
problems, and you can see <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/"><i
class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;all the problems in a list</a>.</p>

<h3>At the end of the week&hellip;</h3>

<p>When you've reached the end of the week, take the <a
href="/calc1-001/quiz/index">End of Week 7 Quiz</a>.  I think you'll
find this quiz to be a bit harder than usual, so let me warn you that
there are five questions involving <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/184"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;l'H&ocirc;pital's rule</a> and five questions involving <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/183"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;related rates</a>.</p>

<p>If you are stuck or confused, please <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">post a message on the
forum</a> or <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">discuss
it with me during office hours</a>.  I want you to succeed, so if
things aren't making sense, please let us know so we can help make
sense of this material!  <strong>Have fun!</strong></p>
