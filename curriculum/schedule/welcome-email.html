<p>Calculus One begins right now, so it is time to start!  Go to the course website at <a href="https://class.coursera.org/calc1-001/class">https://class.coursera.org/calc1-001/class</a> and click on <a href="https://class.coursera.org/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week1">Start Here</a>.</p><p>Calculus is very old, but this is a very new way of presenting it.  By taking calculus out of the classroom, we'll demonstrate applications of calculus that would be hard to do in front of a traditional blackboard.  And since this is online, you'll be able to interact with the graphs, get instant feedback on your work, and discuss mathematics with others in the forum.</p><p>There might be some bumps along the way, but I'm excited to have you partnering with us.  And please remember to fill out the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/calc1-001/quiz/attempt?quiz_id=7">Getting to Know You survey</a>: this will provide information for us to tailor the course to you, so you can participate fully and succeed at calculus.</p><p>Thank you,<br/>~jim</p>
