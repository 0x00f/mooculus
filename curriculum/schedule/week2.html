<h3>The End of Limits</h3>

<p>The second week of Calculus One is here!  We'll start the week by asking <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/64"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;where are we in the course?</a>  If you are feeling lost or overwhelmed, please <strong>let us know</strong> in <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">the forum</a>.  We're here to help you learn calculus.</p>

<h3>What are limits again?</h3>

<p>This is our last week on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function">limits</a>.  We <strong>review limits</strong> by recalling <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/40"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;one-sided limits</a> which you discovered <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/limitsGraphical"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;previously on mooculus</a>.  If you want to <strong>dig into the definitions</strong>, we prepared three <em>bonus</em> videos for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/calc1-001/lecture/70"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;What is the official definition of limit?</a></li>
<li><a href="/calc1-001/lecture/66"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;Why is $$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 2} x^2 = 4$$?</a></li>
<li><a href="/calc1-001/lecture/72"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;Why is $$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 10} 2x = 20$$?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These three videos demonstrate some of what is happening in the very challenging <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Section &sect;1.2 of the Textbook</a>; the bonus material and Section &sect;1.2 should be skipped if you aren't enjoying it, since it won't be needed at all for what follows in the course.</p>

<h3>Continuity?  What does &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; mean?</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope" rel="external">Continuity</a> makes precise the idea that small changes in the input don't affect the output too much.  To <strong>learn the definition</strong>, watch <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/44"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;an introduction to continuity</a> and then <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/continuityGraphical"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;try some practice problems</a>.  You can find more practice problems in <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Section &sect;1.6 of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the functions we think about are continuous: for instance, <strong>polynomials are continuous</strong>.  We'll be considering continuity more in the weeks to come.</p>

<p>Once we know the basics of continuity, we study <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem" rel="external">the intermediate value theorem.</a>  <strong>Learn the statement</strong> by watching <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/52"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;What is the intermediate value theorem?</a>  Then we <strong>apply the theorem</strong> to two problems: <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/30"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;approximating $$\sqrt{2}$$</a> and <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/58"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;finding fixed points</a>.  You can <strong>practice using the theorem</strong> yourself by <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/bisectionOracle"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;finding roots using the bisection method</a>.  Computers use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method" rel="external">this bisection algorithm</a> to approximate roots numerically.</p>

<h3>Infinity?  How can I work with that?</h3>

<p>People have thought about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity" rel="external">infinity</a> for thousands of years; limits provide one way to make such ponderings precise.  To <strong>see how limits handle infinity</strong>, we observe that &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; may play a role in the output or in the input: when the <em>output</em> of a function is as large as we like, we speak about <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/56"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;$$\displaystyle\lim f(x) = \infty$$</a>; when the <em>input</em> is large, we may speak about <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/62"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;$$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)$$</a>.  Pictures of these two situations can be found in <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Section &sect;1.4 and Section &sect;1.5 of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>Be sure to <strong>practice working with infinity</strong> by working through <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/infiniteLimitsGraphical"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;the exercises on mooculus</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes people are tempted to do calculations with $$\infty$$ as if it were a number, but <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/54"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;$$\infty$$ is not a number</a> so you cannot expect &ldquo;calculations&rdquo; like $$\displaystyle\frac{\infty}{\infty}$$ to be meaningful.  It's fun to think about infinity, so you may enjoy debating some <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/68"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;paradoxes involving $$\infty - \infty$$</a> in <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">the forum</a>.</p>

<h3>Slope?</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope" rel="external">Slope</a> measures the &ldquo;steepness&rdquo; of a line.  Because we'll be making use of slope next week when we start studying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative" rel="external">derivatives</a>, it's important to <strong>review slope</strong>, which we do by considering a couple real world problems: <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/40"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;the slope of a staircase</a> and <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/40"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;how fast water drips from a faucet</a>.

<h3>At the end of the week&hellip;</h3>

<p>When you've finished everything else, take the <a href="/calc1-001/quiz/index">End of Week 2 Quiz</a>.  To give you some idea of what will be tested on the quiz, you'll find</p>
<ul>
  <li>one question <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/50"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;reviewing limits</a>,</li>
  <li>three questions which ask you to find a continuous function which agrees with a given function near some point,</li>
  <li>two questions which ask you to compute <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/56"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;limits which may equal $$\infty$$ or $$-\infty$$</a>,</li>
  <li>two questions which ask you to compute <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/62"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;a limit as $$x$$ approaches $$\infty$$</a>, and</li>
  <li>two questions which ask you to <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/44"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;determine whether a given function is continuous.</a></li>
</ul>
