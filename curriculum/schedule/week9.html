<h3>Linear approximation</h3>

<p>Last week, during <a
href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=Week8">Week 8</a>, we looked at
optimization and emphasized word problems.  This week we continue our
applications, but instead of words, we emphasize
numbers&mdash;specifically, numerical analysis and all the numeric
issues that calculus raises.  Even if <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/223"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;you do not really like numbers</a> I hope
that the examples will nevertheless be captivating.</p>

<p>For the last two weeks, the biggest hurdle is converting a word
problem into mathematics; this week, I think the big hurdle has to do
with <em>algorithms</em>; much of this is review, and the big change
this week is that we're doing iterative processes.  I encourage you to
use a calculation device (or much better, a general purpose computer)
to automate the procedures you are learning about.  If you're not
having fun, please let me know <a href="/calc1-001/forum/index">in the
forum</a>&mdash;and to talk in person, we'll hold
<a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">Office Hours</a> on
March 7 at 2:30PM EST.</p>

<h3>What is linear approximation?</h3>

<p>This week is called linear approximation, so what does that even
mean?  The basic idea is the formula
<blockquote>\( f(x+h) = f(x) + h f'(x) \)</blockquote>
which <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/227"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;comes from the definition of the
derivative</a>.  By using linear approximation, you can approximate
the change in a function without actually evaluating the function: a
classic real-world example is approximating the <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/225"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;volume of an orange rind</a>.

<p>You can read more about this
on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;153
of the Textbook</a>.  We also did some exercises along these lines
during <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;Week
3 on mooculus</a>.</p>

<h3>What happens if I repeat linear approximation?</h3>

<p>The derivative tells you how wiggling the input affects the output;
if you do enough wiggling, you can wiggle your way rather far to the
right!  In other words, by performing  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/239"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;repeated linear approximation</a>, otherwise
known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler method</a> you can approximate a function, given
information about its derivative.  To see this sort of technique in action, <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/243"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;compute the natural logarithm of two and
three</a>, and then read 
on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;161
of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>These ideas also appear in the 
during <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/slopeField"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;slope field series of exercises on mooculus</a>.</p>

<h3>What does \(dx\) mean by itself?</h3>

<p>Another way to talk about linear approximation is via <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/245"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;differentials, like \(dx\)</a>.  You can find more about this on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;155 of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<h3>What is Newton's method?</h3>

<p>The derivative can help us approximate zeroes of functions, as
well,
via <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/229"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;Newton's
method.</a>.  If you're standing near a zero of a function, you can
replace the function with the tangent line approximation, figure out
where the tangent line crosses the \(x\)-axis, and then
use <em>that</em> point as a hopefully better approximation to where
the function crosses the \(x\)-axis.  This technique is
described&mdash;with
pictures!&mdash;on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;158
of the Textbook</a>.</p>

<p>There's a couple nice applications of Newton's method.  The obvious
one is to approximate roots of polynomials!  If I were trying to solve
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$, I'd just use <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation">the quadratic
equation</a>, but if I try to solve $$x^5 + x^2 -1 = 0$$, I'm in
trouble, because by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory">Galois theory</a>,
that polynomial's root cannot be expressed using whole numbers, the
usual arithmetic operations (plus, subtract, multiply, divide) and
exponents.  Nevertheless, with Newton's method we can <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/233"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;approximate a point \(x\) so that \( x^5 +
x^2 - 1 = 0 \)</a>.</p>

<p>You can try approximating a root of a polynomial yourself by doing
the <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/exercises/newtonsMethod"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;Newton's
method exercise on mooculus</a>.</p>

<p>Newton's method is the basis of  <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/241"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;Newton-Raphson division</a>, which is a
method for dividing without dividing: by which I mean, you can
approximate $$1/b$$ by adding, subtracting and multiplying repeatedly.</p>

<h3>What is the mean value theorem?</h3>

<p>The <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/231"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;mean value theorem</a> is the main
technical tool for connecting information about the derivative to the
original function.  In words, it says that, given a secant line to a
graph, there is a tangent line with that same slope.  Or more
precisely,
<blockquote>
If \(f\) is continuous on the interval \([a,b]\) and differentiable on
\((a,b)\), then there is a point \(c\) so that \(f'(c) = \displaystyle\frac{f(b) -
f(a)}{b-a}\).
</blockquote>
You can find a proof on <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts"><i class="icon-book"></i>&nbsp;Page&nbsp;165
of the Textbook</a>.  This ends up
having some nice applications, like a <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/235"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;proof that $$f'(x) &gt; 0$$ implies $$f$$ is
increasing</a>.</p>

<p>Many textbook problems on the mean value theorem emphasizing
finding the point $$c$$ where $$f'(c)$$ equals $$\frac{f(b) -
f(a)}{b-a}$$, but <a href="/calc1-001/lecture/237"><i
class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;it is better to regard the mean value
theorem as an existential result<a>.</p>

<h3>At the end of the week&hellip;</h3>

<p>When you feel ready, take the <a
href="/calc1-001/quiz/index">End of Week 9 Quiz</a>.  Let me warn you that

<p>And with that quiz, we finish differentiation and its applications;
if you are having trouble
about anything we've done thus far, please <a
href="/calc1-001/forum/index">let us know on the
forum</a> so we can help out, and <a href="/calc1-001/wiki/view?page=OfficeHours">discuss
it with me during office hours</a>.  Next week we start
antidifferentiation, which sets us up to do integration the following
week&mdash;after breaking you down, we're getting ready to build you
back up again.</p>
