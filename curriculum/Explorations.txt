Newtons method exploration:

Inputs:
A function
An initial x value
Number of iterates to use (drop down up to 10?)
Speed of animation (slider)

____________________

Euler's method exploration:

Inputs:
A differential equation of the form dy/dx = F(x,y)
Length of dx (slider)
starting location (drag point)
start button

---------------------------

Definite integral exploration:

Inputs:
A function 
initial x value
final x value
number of rectangles (slider)

Shows rectangles filling in graph.  Click on any one rectangle to be shown how its area was computed.


_________________________

Fundamental theorem exploration 1:

Inputs: 
Function
initial x value (drag point)
final x value (drag point)

Draws function and an antiderivative of the function.  Shades area on function, gives vector of change on antiderivative.  They are both labeled with the same number.

Fundamental theorem exploration 2:

Inputs:
function
initial x value 
final x value
number of rectangles = number of line segments (slider from 1 to 100)

Draws function and an antiderivative of the function.  Draws rectangles under function and the corresponding line segment on the antiderivative.
