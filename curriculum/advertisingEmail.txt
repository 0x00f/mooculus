Greetings,

This spring the mathematics department of The Ohio state University is proud to offer a 100% free open courseware version of Calculus 1, Math 1151. This course will be taught by Dr. Fowler and Dr. Snapp.

While this course is not for credit, anyone can sign up for free and it would make for an excellent supplement for your students' current instruction. In particular, we believe it would be of benefit to students currently enrolled in calculus classes.

To sign up, go to:

The course begins January 7th. We currently have over 7000 students enrolled worldwide and we would be thrilled if your students would join them.
