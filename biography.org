** Jim Fowler
Jim Fowler teaches mathematics at The Ohio State University.  His
research interests broadly include geometry and topology, and more
specifically, his interests focus on the topology of high-dimensional
manifolds and geometric group theory, which means he gets to think
about highly symmetric (and therefore very beautiful) geometric
objects.  He's particularly fond of using computational techniques to
attack problems in pure mathematics.

Prior to OSU, he received an undergraduate degree from Harvard
University and received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago.
