\chapter{Curve Sketching}



Whether we are interested in a function as a purely mathematical
object or in connection with some application to the real world, it is
often useful to know what the graph of the function looks like. We can
obtain a good picture of the graph using certain crucial information
provided by derivatives of the function and certain limits.

\section{Maxima and Minima}{}{}
\nobreak
A {\dfont local maximum\index{local maximum} point\/} on a function is a
point $(x,y)$ on the graph of the function whose $y$ coordinate is
larger than all other $y$ coordinates on the graph at points ``close
to'' $(x,y)$. More precisely, $(x,f(x))$ is a local maximum if there
is an interval $(a,b)$ with $a<x<b$ and $f(x)\ge f(z)$ for every $z$
in $(a,b)$. Similarly, $(x,y)$ is a {\dfont local minimum\index{local
minimum} point\/} if it has locally the smallest $y$ coordinate. Again
being more precise: $(x,f(x))$ is a local minimum if there
is an interval $(a,b)$ with $a<x<b$ and $f(x)\le f(z)$ for every $z$
in $(a,b)$. A 
{\dfont local extremum\index{local
extremum}\/} is either a local minimum or a local maximum.

Local maximum and minimum points are quite distinctive on the graph of
a function, and are therefore useful in understanding the shape of the
graph. In many applied problems we want to find the largest or
smallest value that a function achieves (for example, we might want
to find the minimum cost at which some task can be performed) and so
identifying maximum and minimum points will be useful for applied
problems as well. Some examples of local maximum and minimum points
are shown in figure~\xrefn{fig:max and min points}.

If $(x,f(x))$ is a point where $f(x)$ reaches a local maximum or minimum,
and if the derivative of $f$ exists at $x$, then the graph has a
tangent line and the tangent line must be horizontal. This is
important enough to state as a theorem, though we will not prove it.

\begin{theorem} (Fermat's Theorem) If $f(x)$ has a local extremum at $x=a$ and
$f$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f'(a)=0$.
\end{theorem}
\index{Fermat's Theorem}

Thus, the only
points at which a function can have a local maximum or minimum are
points at which the derivative is zero, as in the left hand graph in
figure~\xrefn{fig:max and min points},
or the derivative is undefined, as in the right hand graph. Any value
of $x$ for which $f'(x)$ is zero or undefined is called a
{\dfont critical\index{critical value}
value\/} for $f$.
When looking for local maximum and minimum points, you are likely to
make two sorts of mistakes: You may forget that a maximum or minimum
can occur where the derivative does not exist, and so forget to check
whether the derivative exists everywhere. You might also assume that
any place that the derivative is zero is a local maximum or minimum
point, but this is not true. A portion of the graph of $\ds f(x)=x^3$ is
shown in figure~\xrefn{fig:non extremum}. The derivative of $f$ is
$f'(x)=3x^2$, and $f'(0)=0$, but there is neither a maximum nor
minimum at $(0,0)$.

Since the derivative is zero or undefined at both local maximum and
local minimum points, we need a way to determine which, if either,
actually occurs. The most
elementary approach, but one that is often tedious or difficult, is to
test directly whether the $y$ coordinates ``near'' the potential
maximum or minimum are above or below the $y$ coordinate at the point
of interest. Of course, there are too many points ``near'' the point
to test, but a little thought shows we need only test two provided we
know that $f$ is continuous (recall that this means that the graph of
$f$ has no jumps or gaps).

Suppose, for example, that we have identified three points at which
$f'$ is zero or nonexistent: $\ds (x_1,y_1)$, $\ds (x_2,y_2)$, $\ds (x_3,y_3)$,
and $\ds x_1<x_2<x_3$ (see figure~\xrefn{fig:testing for max and
min}). Suppose that we compute the value of $f(a)$ for $\ds x_1<a<x_2$, and
that $\ds f(a)<f(x_2)$. What can we say about the graph between $a$ and
$\ds x_2$? Could there be a point $\ds (b,f(b))$, $\ds a<b<x_2$ with
$\ds f(b)>f(x_2)$? No: if there were, the graph would go up from
$(a,f(a))$ to $(b,f(b))$ then down to $\ds (x_2,f(x_2))$ and somewhere in
between would have a local maximum point. (This is not obvious; it is
a result of the Extreme Value Theorem, theorem~\xrefn{thm:evt}.)
But at that local maximum
point the derivative of $f$ would be zero or nonexistent, yet we
already know that the derivative is zero or nonexistent only at $\ds x_1$,
$\ds x_2$, and $\ds x_3$. The upshot is that one computation tells us that
$\ds (x_2,f(x_2))$ has the largest $y$ coordinate of any point on the
graph near $\ds x_2$ and to the left of $\ds x_2$. We can perform the same
test on the right. If we find that on both sides of $\ds x_2$ the values
are smaller, then there must be a local maximum at $\ds (x_2,f(x_2))$; if
we find that on both sides of $\ds x_2$ the values are larger, then there
must be a local minimum at $\ds (x_2,f(x_2))$; if we find one of each,
then there is neither a local maximum or minimum at $\ds x_2$.

It is not always easy to compute the value of a function at a
particular point. The task is made easier by the availability of
calculators and computers, but they have their own drawbacks---they do
not always allow us to distinguish between values that are very close
together. Nevertheless, because this method is conceptually simple and
sometimes easy to perform, you should always consider it.

\begin{example}
Find all local maximum and minimum points for the function 
$\ds f(x)=x^3-x$. The derivative is $\ds f'(x)=3x^2-1$. This is defined
everywhere and is zero at $\ds x=\pm \sqrt{3}/3$. Looking first at
$\ds x=\sqrt{3}/3$, we see that $\ds f(\sqrt{3}/3)=-2\sqrt{3}/9$. Now we test
two points on either side of 
$\ds x=\sqrt{3}/3$, making sure that neither is farther away than
the nearest critical value; since $\ds \sqrt{3}<3$, $\ds \sqrt{3}/3<1$ and
we can use $x=0$ and $x=1$. Since
$\ds f(0)=0>-2\sqrt{3}/9$
and $\ds f(1)=0>-2\sqrt{3}/9$, there must be a local minimum at 
$\ds x=\sqrt{3}/3$. For $\ds x=-\sqrt{3}/3$, we see that
$\ds f(-\sqrt{3}/3)=2\sqrt{3}/9$. This time we can use $x=0$ and $x=-1$,
and we find that $\ds f(-1)=f(0)=0< 2\sqrt{3}/9$, so there must be a local
maximum at $\ds x=-\sqrt{3}/3$.
\end{example}
\label{exam:simple cubic}

Of course this example is made very simple by our choice of points to
test, namely $x=-1$, $0$, $1$. We could have used other values, say
$-5/4$, $1/3$, and $3/4$, but this would have made the calculations
considerably more tedious.

\begin{example}
\label{example:max and min}
Find all local maximum and minimum points for 
$f(x)=\sin x+\cos x$. The derivative is $f'(x)=\cos x-\sin x$. This is
always defined and is zero whenever $\cos x=\sin x$. Recalling that
the $\cos x$ and $\sin x$ are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of points on
a unit circle, we see that $\cos x=\sin x$ when $x$ is $\pi/4$, 
$\pi/4\pm\pi$, $\pi/4\pm2\pi$, $\pi/4\pm3\pi$, etc. Since both sine
and cosine have a period of $2\pi$, we need only determine the status
of $x=\pi/4$ and $x=5\pi/4$. We can use $0$ and $\pi/2$ to test the
critical value $x= \pi/4$. 
We find that $\ds f(\pi/4)=\sqrt{2}$, $\ds f(0)=1<\sqrt{2}$ and $\ds f(\pi/2)=1$,
so there is a local maximum when $x=\pi/4$ and also when
$x=\pi/4\pm2\pi$, $\pi/4\pm4\pi$, etc. We can summarize this more
neatly by saying that there are local maxima at $\pi/4\pm 2k\pi$ for
every integer $k$.

We use $\pi$ and $2\pi$ to test the critical value $x=5\pi/4$. The
relevant values are $\ds f(5\pi/4)=-\sqrt2$, $\ds f(\pi)=-1>-\sqrt2$,
$\ds f(2\pi)=1>-\sqrt2$, so there is a local minimum at $x=5\pi/4$,
$5\pi/4\pm2\pi$, $5\pi/4\pm4\pi$, etc. More succinctly, there are
local minima at $5\pi/4\pm 2k\pi$ for
every integer $k$.

\section{The first derivative test} {}{}
\nobreak
The method of the previous section for deciding whether there is a
local maximum or minimum at a critical value is not always
convenient. We can instead use information about the derivative
$f'(x)$ to decide; since we have already had to compute the derivative
to find the critical values, there is often relatively little extra
work involved in this method.

How can the derivative tell us whether there is a maximum, minimum, or
neither at a point? Suppose that $f'(a)=0$. If there is a local
maximum when $x=a$, the function must be lower near $x=a$ than it is
right at $x=a$. If the derivative exists near $x=a$, this means
$f'(x)>0$ when $x$ is near $a$ and $x<a$, because the function must
``slope up'' just to the left of $a$. Similarly, $f'(x)<0$ when $x$ is
near $a$ and $x>a$, because $f$ slopes down from the local maximum as
we move to the right. Using the same reasoning, if there is a local
minimum at $x=a$, the derivative of $f$ must be negative just to the
left of $a$ and positive just to the right. If the derivative exists
near $a$ but does not change from positive to negative or negative to
positive, that is, it is positive on both sides or negative on both
sides, then there is neither a maximum nor minimum when $x=a$.
See the first graph in figure~\xrefn{fig:max and min points}
and the graph in figure~\xrefn{fig:non extremum}
for examples.

\begin{example} Find all local maximum and minimum points for $f(x)=\sin x+\cos
x$ using the first derivative test.  The derivative is $f'(x)=\cos
x-\sin x$ and from example~\xrefn{example:max and min} the critical
values we need to consider are $\pi/4$ and $5\pi/4$.

The graphs of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ are shown in figure~\xrefn{fig:sin
  and cos}. Just to the left of $\pi/4$ the cosine is larger than the
  sine, so $f'(x)$ is positive; just to the right the cosine is
  smaller than the sine, so $f'(x)$ is negative. This means there is a
  local maximum at $\pi/4$. Just to the left of $5\pi/4$ the cosine is
  smaller than the sine, and to the right the cosine is larger than
  the sine. This means that the derivative $f'(x)$ is negative to the
  left and positive to the right, so $f$ has a local minimum at
  $5\pi/4$.
\end{example}

\section{The second derivative test} {}{}
\nobreak
The basis of the first derivative test is that if the derivative
changes from positive to negative at a point at which the derivative
is zero then there is a local maximum at the point, and similarly for
a local minimum. If $f'$ changes from positive to negative it is
decreasing; this means that the derivative of $f'$, $f''$, might be negative,
and if in fact $f''$ is negative then $f'$ is definitely
decreasing, so there is a local maximum at the point in question. Note
well that $f'$ might change from positive to negative while $f''$ is
zero, in which case $f''$ gives us no information about the critical
value. Similarly, if $f'$ changes from negative to positive there is a
local minimum at the point, and $f'$ is increasing. If $f''>0$ at the
point, this tells us that $f'$ is increasing, and so there is a local
minimum. 

\begin{example}
Consider again $f(x)=\sin x + \cos x$, with $f'(x)=\cos x-\sin x$ and
$ f''(x)=-\sin x -\cos x$. Since $\ds f''(\pi/4)=-\sqrt{2}/2-\sqrt2/2=-\sqrt2<0$,
we know there is a local maximum at $\pi/4$. Since
$\ds f''(5\pi/4)=--\sqrt{2}/2--\sqrt2/2=\sqrt2>0$, there is a local
minimum at $5\pi/4$.
\end{example}

When it works, the second derivative test is often the easiest way to
identify local maximum and minimum points. Sometimes the test fails,
and sometimes the second derivative is quite difficult to evaluate; in
such cases we must fall back on one of the previous tests.

\begin{example}
Let $\ds f(x)=x^4$. The derivatives are $\ds f'(x)=4x^3$ and
$\ds f''(x)=12x^2$. Zero is the only critical value, but $f''(0)=0$, so
the second derivative test tells us nothing. However, $f(x)$ is
positive everywhere except at zero, so clearly $f(x)$ has a local
minimum at zero. On the other hand, $\ds f(x)=-x^4$ also has zero as its
only critical value, and the second derivative is again zero, but
$\ds -x^4$ has a local maximum at zero.
\end{example}

\section{Concavity and inflection points} {}{}
\nobreak
We know that the sign of the derivative tells us whether a function is
increasing or decreasing; for example, when $f'(x)>0$,
$f(x)$ is increasing. The sign of the second derivative
$f''(x)$ tells us whether $f'$ is increasing or decreasing; we have
seen that if $f'$ is zero and increasing at a point then there is a
local minimum at the point, and if $f'$ is zero and decreasing at a
point then there is a local maximum at the point. Thus, we extracted
information about $f$ from information about $f''$. 

We can get information from the sign of $f''$ even when $f'$ is not
zero. Suppose that $f''(a)>0$. This means that near $x=a$, $f'$ is
increasing. If $f'(a)>0$, this means that $f$ slopes up and is getting
steeper; if $f'(a)<0$, this means that $f$ slopes down and is getting
{\it less\/} steep. The two situations are shown in
figure~\xrefn{fig:concave up}. A curve that is shaped like this is
called {\dfont concave\index{concave up} up.}

Now suppose that $f''(a)<0$. This means that near $x=a$, $f'$ is
decreasing. If $f'(a)>0$, this means that $f$ slopes up and is getting
less steep; if $f'(a)<0$, this means that $f$ slopes down and is getting
steeper. The two situations are shown in
figure~\xrefn{fig:concave down}. A curve that is shaped like this is

If we are trying to understand the shape of the graph of a function,
knowing where it is concave up and concave down helps us to get a more
accurate picture. Of particular interest are points at which the
concavity changes from up to down or down to up; such points are
called {\dfont inflection\index{inflection point} points.} If the
concavity changes from up to down at $x=a$, $f''$ changes from
positive to the left of $a$ to negative to the right of $a$, and
usually $f''(a)=0$. We can identify such points by first finding where
$f''(x)$ is zero and then checking to see whether $f''(x)$ does in
fact go from positive to negative or negative to positive at these
points. Note that it is possible that $f''(a)=0$ but the concavity is
the same on both sides; $\ds f(x)=x^4$ at $x=0$ is an example.

\begin{example}
Describe the concavity of $\ds f(x)=x^3-x$. $\ds f'(x)=3x^2-1$, $f''(x)=6x$.
Since $f''(0)=0$, there is potentially an inflection point at
zero. Since $f''(x)>0$ when $x>0$ and $f''(x)<0$ when $x<0$ the
concavity does change from down to up at zero, and the curve is
concave down for all $x<0$ and concave up for all $x>0$.
\end{example}

Note that we need to compute and analyze the second derivative to
understand concavity, so we may as well try to use the second
derivative test for maxima and minima. If for some reason this fails
we can then try one of the other tests.

\section{Asymptotes and Other Things to Look For}  {}{}
\nobreak
A vertical asymptote\index{asymptote} is a place where the function
becomes infinite, typically because the formula for the function has a
denominator that becomes zero.  For example, the reciprocal function
$f(x)=1/x$ has a vertical asymptote at $x=0$, and the function $\tan
x$ has a vertical asymptote at $x=\pi/2$ (and also at $x=-\pi/2$,
$x=3\pi/2$, etc.).  Whenever the formula for a function contains a
denominator it is worth looking for a vertical asymptote by 
checking to see if the denominator can ever be zero, and then checking
the limit at such points. Note that there is not always a vertical
asymptote where the derivative is zero: $f(x)=(\sin x)/x$ has a zero
denominator at $x=0$, but since $\ds \lim_{x\to 0}(\sin x)/x=1$ there is
no asymptote there.

A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line to which $f(x)$ gets closer and
closer as $x$ approaches $\infty$ (or as $x$ approaches $-\infty$).  For
example, the reciprocal function has the $x$-axis for a horizontal
asymptote.  Horizontal asymptotes can be identified by computing 
the limits $\ds \lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)$ and $\ds \lim_{x \to -\infty}f(x)$.
Since $\ds \lim_{x \to \infty}1/x=\lim_{x \to -\infty}1/x=0$, the line
$y=0$ (that is, the $x$-axis) is a horizontal asymptote in both directions.

Some functions have asymptotes that are neither horizontal nor
vertical, but some other line. Such asymptotes are somewhat more
difficult to identify and we will ignore them.

If the domain of the function does not extend out to infinity, we should
also ask what happens as $x$ approaches the boundary of the domain.  For
example, the function $\ds y=f(x)=1/\sqrt{r^2-x^2}$ has domain $-r<x<r$, and
$y$ becomes infinite as $x$ approaches either $r$ or $-r$. In this
case we might also identify this behavior because when $x=\pm r$ the
denominator of the function is zero.

If there are any points where the derivative fails to exist (a cusp or
corner), then we should take special note of what the function does at such
a point.

Finally, it is worthwhile to notice any symmetry.  A function $f(x)$ that
has the same value for $-x$ as for $x$, i.e., $f(-x)=f(x)$, is called an
``even function.''  Its graph is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis.
Some examples of even functions are: $\ds x^n$ when $n$ is an even number,
$\cos x$, and $\ds \sin^2x$.  On the other hand, a function that satisfies the
property $f(-x)=-f(x)$ is called an ``odd function.''  Its graph is
symmetric with respect to the origin.  Some examples of odd functions are:
$x^n$ when $n$ is an odd number, $\sin x$, and $\tan x$.  Of course, most
functions are neither even nor odd, and do not have any particular
symmetry.

% Example 1
\begin{example}

Sketch $y=x^3-x$.

\smallskip
\begin{rightindent}{3.5in}
First, we set $0=y'=3x^2-1$, which has solutions $x=\pm\sqrt{3}/3=\pm
0.577$.  The corresponding $y$-coordinates are $-0.385$ and $+0.385$, i.e.,
the two ``critical points'' are $(0.577,-0.385)$ and $(-0.577,0.385)$.  The
second derivative test gives $y''=6x$, which is positive for the first
point and negative for the second.  Thus, the first of the two points (in
the fourth quadrant) is a local minimum, and the second is a local maximum.
Since $y''>0$ when $x>0$ and $y''<0$ when $x<0$, it follows that the curve
is concave upward in the right half of the graph and concave down-

%------------------------------
ward in the left half. The two halves are
separated by the inflection point at the origin.  This curve has no
asymptotes.  It does have symmetry, however, because it is an odd function.
Its graph is shown above.

\end{example}

\begin{rightindent}{3in}
% Example 2
\begin{example}

Sketch $y=x^3+x$.

\smallskip

The only difference with Example 13.1 is the $+$ in front of the $x$.  But
this means that the derivative $y'=3x^2+1$ is {\it never} zero, and hence
there are no maxima or minima.  In fact, the function is always increasing,
because $y'$ is always positive.  The second derivative $y''=6x$ is the
same as in the last problem, and hence the concavity situation is the same.
In particular, this curve also has an inflection point at the origin.

\end{example}
\end{rightindent}
\hfill
%--- figure NE (curve sketching--Example 2)--------------------
\begin{psfigure}{2in}{2in}{124.figNE.ps}
\end{psfigure} 
%------------------------------

% Example 3
\begin{example}

Sketch $y=x^2-\cos(2x)$ for $-\pi/2\le x\le\pi/2$.

\smallskip

When we set $0=y'=2x+2\sin(2x)$, we obtain the equality $\sin(2x)=-x$.
However, from a quick sketch of the two curves $\sin(2x)$ and $-x$, we
immediately see that the only $x$ for which they are equal is $x=0$.  When
$x=0$ the $y$-coordinate is $0^2-\cos(2\cdot 0)=-1$, so our critical point
is $(0,-1)$.  Since $y''=2+4\cos(2x)$, which is positive when $x=0$, the
second derivative test tells us that $(0,1)$ is a local minimum.  To find
inflection points we set $0=y''=2+4\cos(2x)$.  This gives $\cos(2x)=-0.5$.
Looking at our table in the section on trig functions, we see that in the
range from $x=0$ to $x=\pi/2$ the equality $\cos(2x)=-0.5$ holds when
$2x=\frac{2}{ 3}\pi$, 
\begin{rightindent}{3in}
\noindent
i.e., $x=\pi/3$.  Since $\cos(-2x)=\cos(2x)$, the
equality also holds when $x=-\pi/3$.  Thus, the points $(\pi/3,1.5966)$ and
$(-\pi/3,1.5966)$ are inflection points.  Between these two inflection
points the second derivative is positive (concave up), whereas for
$x>\pi/3$ and for $x<-\pi/3$ the second derivative is negative (concave
downward).  Finally, note that $x^2-\cos(2x)$ is an even function, and so
the graph is symmetrical with respect to the $y$-axis.

%------------------------------
\end{example}

% Example 4
\begin{example}

Sketch $y=x^2+\frac{1}{ x}$.

\smallskip

Setting $0=y'=2x-\frac{1}{ x^2}$, we solve this by bringing $1/x^2$ to the
left and clearing denominators: $1=2x\cdot x^2=2x^3$.  So $x={\root
3\of{0.5}}= 0.7937$.  The corresponding $y$-coordinate is 1.8899.  Using
the second derivative $y''=2+2\cdot x^{-3}$, we see that this 
\begin{rightindent}{3in}
\noindent
is a local minimum.  To find inflections, we set $2+2/x^3=0$.  Clearing
denominators and solving for $x$ gives $x^3=-1$, and so $x=-1$.  Thus, the
point $(-1,0)$ is an inflection.  In this example we have an asymptote when
$x=0$.  To the right of the asymptote (i.e., for positive $x$), the second
derivative is always positive; whereas for negative $x$ the second
derivative is positive when $x<-1$ and negative when $x$ is between $-1$
and $0$.  Thus, the interval $-1<x<0$ is a region of downward concavity;
the graph is concave upward outside of this interval.  Putting all this
together leads to the graph at the right.

\begin{psfigure}{2.0in}{2.0in}{124.figNG.ps}
\end{psfigure}
%------------------------------

\smallskip

There is another way to think of this example.  Our function is the sum of
two functions $x^2$ and $1/x$.  The former function is by far the larger of
the two when $x$ is large positive or large negative, whereas the
reciprocal function is by far the more important when $x$ is near 0.  Thus,
the graph resembles $1/x$ when $x$ is near 0 and resembles $x^2$ when $x$
is far from 0.  Roughly speaking, the inflection point $(-1,0)$ and the
local minimum $(0.7937,1.8899)$ mark the transition from behaving like the
graph of $x^2$ to behaving like the graph of $1/x$.

\end{example}

% Example 5
\begin{example}

Sketch (a) $y=x^3$ and (b) $y=x^4$.

\smallskip


(a) Setting $0=y'=3x^2$, we see that the origin is a possible maximum or
minimum.  However, the second derivative test tells us nothing, since
$y''=6x$ also is zero when $x=0$.  In fact, even though $y'=0$ when $x=0$,
the origin is neither a maximum nor a minimum.  Rather, it is a point of
inflection, separating the concave downward region in the third quadrant
from the concave upward region in the first quadrant.

\smallskip


(b) Again we see that both the first derivative and the second derivative
vanish at the origin (and neither derivative is zero anywhere else).  This
time, however, the origin is a local minimum.  Even though the second derivative
test doesn't tell us this, we can see directly that, since $x^4$ is
positive for nonzero $x$, its smallest possible value is when $x=0$.  Note
that the origin is {\it not} a point of inflection, even though $y''=0$
there.  This is because $y''=12x^2>0$ both for $x>0$ and for $x<0$, so
everywhere we have upward concavity.  (It is rare for a point where $y''=0$
not to be an inflection point; this can occur only when the {\it third}
derivative $y^{\prime\prime\prime}$ is also zero at the same point.)

% Example 6
\begin{example}

Sketch $y=x^5-5x^4+5x^3$.

\smallskip

First, we set $0=y'=5x^4-20x^3+15x^2$.  To solve this, we factor out what
we can, namely $5x^2$.  This leaves a quadratic that can be factored either
by inspection or by the quadratic formula.  The result is
$0=y'=5x^2(x-1)(x-3)$.  Thus, the critical points are $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, and
$(3,-27)$.  Using $y''=20x^3-60x^2+30x=10x(2x^2-6x+3)$, we see from the
second derivative test that $(1,1)$ is a local maximum and $(3,-27)$ is a
local minimum, but we get no information about $(0,0)$.  Setting $0=y''$
and using the quadratic formula to find the roots of $2x^2-6x+3$, we find
the following three points of inflection: $(0,0)$, $(0.634,0.569)$,
$(2.366,-16.32)$.

\begin{rightindent}{3.0in}
\noindent
  In a complicated case like
this, it is also worthwhile to see what the function is doing when $x$ is
large positive or large negative.  If $x$ is large, the $x^5$ term in our
function dominates (is greater in absolute value than all the other terms).
Thus, the function heads upward steeply into the first quadrant as
$x\longrightarrow+\infty$, and it heads steeply down into the third
quadrant as $x\longrightarrow-\infty$.  Putting this information together,
we obtain the graph shown above.  The curve is concave downward in the
third quadrant, and also between the two points of inflection
$(0.634,0.569)$ and $(2.366,-16.32)$.  For $0<x<0.634$ and for $x>2.366$
the curve is concave upward.
