When you initially start working:

  git checkout master
  git pull
  git checkout -b this-is-what-im-working-on

For example

  git checkout master
  git pull
  git checkout -b snapp

Here "snapp" is my branch
	

As you work:

  git status
  git add list-of-files-i-changed
  git commit -m "here is what I did"

When you want to contribute what you've done

  git checkout master
  git merge this-is-what-im-working-on
  git push

The this-is-what-im-working-on might be "assessor" or "textbook" or
"lectures" or whatever.
