<!--Use random function generation from approxLimits, but allow user to evaluate f at the given X value.  
	Give multiple choice answers, ex:
		f is continous at x=2
		f is discontinuous at x=2 with a point discontinuity
		f is discontinuous at x=2 with a jump discontinuity
		f is discontinuous at x=2 because lim_{x \to 2^+} fails to exist
		f is discontinuous at x=2 because lim_{x \to 2^-} fails to exist
		f is discontinuous at x=2 because the limits from the left and right both fail to exist

                    Consider a function <code>f(x)</code>. While
                    you don't know the formula for <code>f(x)</code>
                    you can nevertheless still evaluate it for given
                    values of <code>x</code>.  Does <code>f</code> appear to be continuous at
                    <code>x = <var>X</var></code>?    If not, why?
